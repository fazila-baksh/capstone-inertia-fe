# inertia

## Overview

inertia is a lifestyle app that allows users to track their daily habits. It is designed to help individuals maintain consistency in building habits and stay motivated.

### Problem Space

Building and maintaining habits can be challenging, especially without a system to track progress and stay motivated. Inertia addresses this pain point by providing a user-friendly platform for habit tracking, enabling users to visualize their progress and build consistent routines.

### User Profile

Who will use your app?

- Individuals looking to develop and maintain positive habits.
- Individuals seeking a simple and effective tool to track their progress.

How will they use it?

- Users will add the habits they would like to track and check off completed habits daily and review their progress.

### Features

- As a user, I want to be able to create a list of habits I want to track (e.g., exercise, reading, hydration).
- As a user, I want to be able to set goals for my habits (e.g. 7 days a week).
- As a user, I want to be able to track my progress (how many times have I completed the habit in a week/month)
- As a user, I want to log my daily progress for each habit (e.g., mark that I exercised today).
- As a user, I want to view my progress over time for each habit.
